### Abstract: 

Breast cancer is the most common cancer, accounting for approximately 33% of all cancers diagnosed among women in Wisconsin. It has been 40 years since the first case was collected by the Wisconsin Cancer Report system (WCRS). Early detection plays an essential role in breast cancer treatment by boosting the chance for timely intervention. Moreover, the increase in the incidence of this cancer shows no sign of stopping, which is why this topic has received much attention from researchers, including expert systems and machine learning techniques. This study aims to identify breast cancer cells using non-invasive and technology-involved methods and determining which variables are significant to the classification by using Supervise and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
