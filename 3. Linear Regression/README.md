### The Linear Regession 

Linear Regression is one of the most basic and popular algorithms of Supervised Learning, where the prediction output is continuous. Linear regression is used for analysing and predicting. This algorithm is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar criterion or response and multiple predictors or explanatory variables. Linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response for the values of the predictors.

### Machine Learning - Linear Regression Algorithm 

Linear Regression or Linear Regression is an algorithm that aims to find the coefficients of an equation:

+ Pre-Activation Function: Z = w<sub>1</sub> x<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub> x<sub>2</sub> + ... + w<sub>n</sub> x<sub>n</sub>
+ Post Activation function: a = &Phi;(z) = z
+ Cost function: 
![C(w, b) = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{N}^{i = 1} (\hat{y}^{i} - y^{i})^{2}](http://mathurl.com/render.cgi?E%20%3D%20mc%20%5E%202%5Cnocache)
